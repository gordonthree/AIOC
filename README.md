# AIOC
Audio Interface Optimal Configuration

# Goals
* Refactor firmware for STM32F446 processor, used on the RB STM32-DVM v4 interface
* Refactor firmware for STM32G431 processor, used on the Nucleo-G431RB dev board
* Design a PCB for one of the above STM chips with a mimimal BOM to support various ham radio audio interface needs
